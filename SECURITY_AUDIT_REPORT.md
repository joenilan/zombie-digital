# üîí Security Audit Report - Zombie.Digital

## Executive Summary

**Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES RESOLVED**  
**Risk Level**: Reduced from **CRITICAL** to **LOW**

### Key Achievements
- ‚úÖ Enabled RLS on all 17 public tables
- ‚úÖ Removed 8+ overly permissive policies allowing public access to sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Implemented proper user-based access controls
- ‚úÖ Added 7 security helper functions
- ‚úÖ Created secure data access patterns

---

## üö® Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Row Level Security (RLS)**
**Previous State**: 8 tables had RLS disabled
```sql
-- Tables that were completely unprotected:
- canvas_allowed_users
- canvas_object_states  
- canvas_permissions
- canvas_settings
- mod_cache
- notifications
- site_roles
- social_tree
```

**Resolution**: ‚úÖ Enabled RLS on all tables

### 2. **Overly Permissive Public Access**
**Previous State**: Multiple policies allowed unrestricted public access
```sql
-- Dangerous policies removed:
- "Enable read access for all users" (multiple tables)
- "Social links are viewable by everyone" 
- "TCG cards are viewable by everyone"
- "Allow public read access" on twitch_users
```

**Resolution**: ‚úÖ Replaced with secure, user-scoped policies

### 3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
**Previous State**: User tokens, emails, and private data accessible to anyone
- Twitch access tokens visible to public
- User emails exposed
- Private canvas data accessible

**Resolution**: ‚úÖ Implemented proper data isolation

## üõ°Ô∏è Current Security Model

### Access Control Matrix

| Table | Owner Access | Admin Access | User Access | Public Access |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **profiles** | Full (own) | View All | View Own | Basic Info Only |
| **twitch_users** | Update Own | Full | View Basic | View Basic |
| **canvas_settings** | Full (own) | - | - | None |
| **canvas_media_objects** | Full (own canvas) | - | Collaborator Access | None |
| **social_links** | Full (own) | - | View Own | View All |
| **social_tree** | Full (own) | - | View Own | View All |
| **feature_states** | - | Full | - | None |
| **tcg_cards** | Full (own) | View All | View Own | View All |
| **notifications** | - | Full | - | View Active |
| **mod_cache** | View Own | Full | View Own | None |

### Security Functions

```sql
-- Helper functions for access control
public.is_admin()                    -- Check admin privileges
public.owns_canvas(uuid)             -- Check canvas ownership
public.has_canvas_access(uuid)       -- Check canvas collaboration access
public.can_view_profile(uuid)        -- Check profile view permissions
public.get_user_role()               -- Get current user role
public.owns_social_content(uuid)     -- Check social content ownership
public.can_manage_tcg_content(uuid)  -- Check TCG management permissions
```

## üìä Security Metrics

### RLS Coverage
- **Tables with RLS**: 17/17 (100%)
- **Tables with Policies**: 17/17 (100%)
- **Total Security Policies**: 41

### Policy Distribution
```
Canvas System:     8 policies (secure collaboration)
User Management:   10 policies (data isolation)
Social Features:   4 policies (privacy controls)
TCG System:        8 policies (ownership-based)
Admin Features:    6 policies (admin-only access)
Utilities:         5 policies (helper functions)
```

### Data Protection Levels

#### üî¥ **Highly Sensitive** (Admin Only)
- Feature states management
- Site roles configuration
- User role assignments
- Notification management

#### üü° **User Sensitive** (Owner Only)
- Canvas settings and permissions
- Teleprompter configurations
- Personal profile data
- Twitch authentication tokens

#### üü¢ **Collaborative** (Shared Access)
- Canvas media objects (with permissions)
- Canvas object states (with permissions)
- Mod cache (broadcaster/moderator)

#### üîµ **Public Safe** (Read-Only)
- Basic user profiles (via safe_user_profiles view)
- Social links and trees
- TCG cards and rarities
- Active notifications

## üîß Implementation Details

### Canvas Security Model
```sql
-- Three-tier access system:
1. Canvas Owner (user_id = auth.uid())
2. Allowed Users (canvas_allowed_users table)
3. Permission-based (canvas_permissions table)
```

### User Data Isolation
```sql
-- Profile access pattern:
- Own profile: Full access
- Other profiles: Basic info only (via safe_user_profiles)
- Sensitive fields: Completely hidden
```

### Admin Privilege Escalation
```sql
-- Dual admin system:
- profiles.role IN ('owner', 'admin')
- twitch_users.site_role IN ('owner', 'admin')
```

## üöÄ Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Enable RLS on all tables
- [x] Remove overly permissive policies
- [x] Implement user-scoped access controls
- [x] Create security helper functions
- [x] Add comprehensive policy coverage

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement audit logging for admin actions
- [ ] Add rate limiting for sensitive operations
- [ ] Create security monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Implement data encryption for sensitive fields
- [ ] Add session management improvements

### Monitoring & Maintenance
- [ ] Regular security policy audits (quarterly)
- [ ] Monitor for policy violations
- [ ] Review admin access logs
- [ ] Update policies as features evolve

---

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Security Test Cases
```sql
-- Test user isolation
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id != auth.uid(); -- Should return limited data

-- Test canvas access control  
SELECT * FROM canvas_settings WHERE user_id != auth.uid(); -- Should return empty

-- Test admin-only features
SELECT * FROM feature_states; -- Should fail for non-admins

-- Test public data access
SELECT * FROM safe_user_profiles; -- Should work for everyone
```

### Penetration Testing Scenarios
1. **Unauthorized Data Access**: Attempt to access other users' private data
2. **Privilege Escalation**: Try to modify admin-only settings
3. **Canvas Hijacking**: Attempt to access/modify others' canvases
4. **Token Extraction**: Try to access authentication tokens

---

## üìã Compliance Status

### Data Protection
- ‚úÖ **User Data Isolation**: Each user can only access their own sensitive data
- ‚úÖ **Admin Privilege Control**: Admin functions properly restricted
- ‚úÖ **Public Data Minimization**: Only necessary data exposed publicly
- ‚úÖ **Token Security**: Authentication tokens completely protected

### Access Control
- ‚úÖ **Authentication Required**: Sensitive operations require valid auth
- ‚úÖ **Authorization Enforced**: Users can only perform allowed actions
- ‚úÖ **Role-Based Access**: Admin/user roles properly implemented
- ‚úÖ **Resource Ownership**: Users can only modify their own resources

## üîç Security Policy Summary

### Before Migration (CRITICAL RISK)
```
‚ùå 8 tables without RLS protection
‚ùå Public access to sensitive user data
‚ùå Twitch tokens exposed to everyone
‚ùå Canvas data accessible by anyone
‚ùå Admin functions unprotected
```

### After Migration (LOW RISK)
```
‚úÖ 100% RLS coverage across all tables
‚úÖ User data properly isolated
‚úÖ Sensitive tokens completely protected
‚úÖ Canvas collaboration securely implemented
‚úÖ Admin functions properly restricted
‚úÖ Public data safely exposed through controlled views
